# File_Split
### A python tool to split file 

```
This function is from CSDN,I encapsulated it a little
Upload is for easy use in the future
Because I don't remember where I saw it, I don't add a link.
If there is any infringement, I will delete it immediately.
```
You should only enter two parameters, the first is the directory you want to cut the file, and the second is how many lines you need to cut a file.
  
  Just like


```python file_split.py /mnt/1.csv 2000```
